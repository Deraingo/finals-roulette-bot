# Finals Roulette Bot
This bot is a passion project. I plan to update it as the finals is updated as well as try and add new features to it. 
**Add it to your discord here https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1426751245200265366&permissions=171799021632&scope=bot%20applications.commands**

## Commands 
`!roulette` -> generates a random loadout.  

## Running The Bot Yourself
**If you want your own version of the bot:**  
1. Fork this repo and clone it to your local device
2. Create a `.env` with the a variable named `DISCORD_TOKEN`
3. Create a project in Discord for your bot and get the key from the discord app and apply it as the environment variable.  

## Roadmap
`!roulette <class name>` -> generates a random loadout of the specified class.
